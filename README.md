# Install Arch Linux
My install scripts for Arch Linux on my Tuxedo Pulse 15 Gen2 laptop with an SSD. Most should be general enough for anyone to use the same. The scripts set up Secure Boot with the TPM2 and full disk encryption. Don't blindly run them. I have not tested them and they are mostly notes from my own manual install.
